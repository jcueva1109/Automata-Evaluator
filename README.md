# Automata Evaluator
## by Jesus Cueva

This program is made to evaluate a JSON file which has the information about an Automata. This automata can be either a DFA, NFA, or E-NFA. It's a console program, and you'll be prompted to input the JSON file from an emerging window. In addition, it'll show you a graphed diagram showing how the automata looks like. <br>
